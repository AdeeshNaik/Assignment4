The objective is to develop a recommendation engine the recommends movie to users. It provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user preferences and browsing history. 
The information about the user is taken as an input that is in the form of browsing data. This information reflects the prior viewing of the movies as well as the assigned ratings.

There are two types of recommendation systems â€“ Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation and we will be using collaborative filtering recommendation system and more specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system (IBCF).
